/**
 * @class UURLabShmRpcTransport
 * @brief Shared-memory implementation of the bridge's RPC transport.
 *
 * Owns two SHM regions per session:
 *   `req.shm` -- bridge writes msgpack request, UE reads.
 *   `rep.shm` -- UE writes msgpack reply, bridge reads.
 *
 * Bridge-owned UObject (NOT a UActorComponent). Co-exists with
 * `UURLabZmqRpcTransport`; clients pick which transport to talk to.
 *
 * **Scope: manager-required ops only.** SHM is the latency-optimised
 * inner-loop transport (1 kHz controller channels). Editor-only ops
 * (`import_xml`, `spawn_actor`, `list_actors`, etc.) get a
 * `wrong_transport: use_zmq` reply via the base class's
 * `AcceptsEditorOps()=false` short-circuit. The bridge-side client
 * auto-routes editor ops to ZMQ; nothing needs to be re-tried.
